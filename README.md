Public code for RL table tennis implementation from my youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8noFZeCcXM&t=221s
The main dependencies are sb3 - https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/,
gymnasium (not gym!) - https://gymnasium.farama.org,
and pybullet.
After cloning the repo, cd to tt3_env and do "pip install -e ."
Then you can run tt3_agent/tt3_agent.py.
